A skateboard is rolling on an empty street. Narration - Do you think I need direction?
A homeless boy stops it. Rolls on it. Narration - I do need the direction. It's a wild wolrd. But, I do know it's a wonderful world. I want to see it.
The homeless boy reaches the RoseBudCafe and hangs the skateboad on the door/wall. It has rosebud written on it. Narration - Welcome to Rosebud Cafe.
